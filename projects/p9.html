            <p>
                In an increasingly urbanizing world, the preservation of biodiversity in urban habitats is becoming more
                and more crucial.
                This Project is focused on the analysis of biodiversity monitoring data to provide a better
                understanding of it.
                In the research project Mitwelten, automated data collection systems were used to collect and analyze
                various datasets, including observations of birds, pollinators, and human presence.
                The data that has been collected continuously over long periods provides an interesting basis for the
                exploration of biodiversity.
                For the interpretation of the datasets, the challenge is to find the right view of the data to identify
                important phenomena and correlations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this work was to develop an interactive application, called "Mitwelten Explore," to visually
                explore datasets, compare them to each other, and identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
                In the first step, the fundamentals of UX/UI design, data visualization, and data management were
                elaborated.
                In the second phase, it was analyzed how the existing data can be filtered to explore and compare
                subsets of it. For the investigation of further variables influencing biodiversity, additional data from
                external sources, including meteorological data, were obtained.
                To operate the application, a clear workflow was developed, which is comparable to the operation of an
                online store. To enable researchers to share their findings with others, a concept for writing
                annotations was developed.
                In the final phase of the project, the application was implemented using an iterative development
                principle. In addition to the Explore tool, the data collected in the Mitwelten project was made
                available via an API to enable further analysis with third-party tools. </p>
            <p>
                The developed application provides an efficient and user-friendly solution for the exploration and
                analysis of ecologically relevant data and contributes to an improved understanding of biodiversity in
                urban terrains.
